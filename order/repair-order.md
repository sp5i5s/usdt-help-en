# ðŸš© Manual replenishment order

Due to the uniqueness of blockchain transfer operations (the transfer amount is usually manually entered by the user), it is inevitable that the actual payment amount paid by the user does not match the order amount, resulting in order loss (order timeout failure).


## Manual replenishment order

Merchants can go to the merchant backend, click [Single Supplement] in the order page, and enter the transaction hash, merchant order number and other information to manually replenish the order. After the replenishment order succeeds, the order status callback will be successful.
